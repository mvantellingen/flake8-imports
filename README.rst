Flake8 imports plugin
---------------------

Flake8 extension to run isort check over the source files.


Installation
------------

  pip install flake8-imports


Alternatives
------------
There are already other similar implementations available, these are:

 * https://github.com/gforcada/flake8-isort
 * https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order

The reason for this module is that both of these didn't match my
requirements (license, keep logic within isort)
